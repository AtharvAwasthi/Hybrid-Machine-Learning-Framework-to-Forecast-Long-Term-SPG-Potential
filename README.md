# Hybrid-Machine-Learning-Framework-to-Forecast-Long-Term-SPG-Potential
This project highlights my independent work with the Modular Robotics (GRASP) Lab at the University of Pennsylvania.
I developed a climate-change-informed algorithm based on three learning models (Prophet, RFR, CNN) to forecast long-term solar power generation.
Datasets were exported from Kaggle.
